Absolutely, David. Here's your **refined full `setup.md`**, now with Git identity setup folded in—clean, minimal, and ready for your next class. It models everything from launching VS Code in WSL to pushing the first commit with token-based authentication.

## 📘 `setup.md`: Microblog Setup Guide (WSL + VS Code + GitHub)

```markdown
# 🧠 Microblog Setup Guide

This guide walks you through finalizing your dev setup and pushing your first commit to GitHub.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Open WSL and Launch VS Code

```bash
wsl
cd ~/projects/microblog
code .
```

> 💡 You should see `WSL: Ubuntu` in the bottom-left corner of VS Code.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Add `.vscode/settings.json`

Create a `.vscode` folder and add this file:

```json
{
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
  "git.enableSmartCommit": true,
  "git.confirmSync": false,
  "liveServer.settings.port": 5500,
  "extensions.ignoreRecommendations": false
}
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Run the Extension Install Script

Inside WSL, run:

```bash
bash install_extensions.sh
```

> 📦 Installs Python, Pylance, Jupyter, and Remote WSL extensions.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Set Your Git Identity

Run these commands inside WSL:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

> 💡 Use the same email as your GitHub account.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Create a GitHub Repo

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **New repository**
3. Name it `microblog`
4. Leave it empty (no README, .gitignore, or license)

---

## ✅ Step 6: Set Up GitHub Authentication

### 🔐 Enable 2FA with Authenticator App

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Passwords and authentication](https://github.com/settings/security)
2. Click **Enable two-factor authentication**
3. Choose **Authenticator app**
4. Open your app (e.g. Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator)
5. Tap **Add account** → **Scan QR code**
6. Hold your phone over the QR code shown on GitHub
7. Enter the 6-digit code to confirm

---

### 🔑 Generate a Classic Token

1. Go to [Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Select:
   - **repo** scope
   - Expiration: 30 days
4. Copy and save the token securely

---

## ✅ Step 7: Initialize Git and Push First Commit

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/microblog.git
git config --global credential.helper store
git push -u origin main
```

> 💡 When prompted, enter your GitHub username and paste the token as your password. Git will remember it for future pushes.

---

## 🔁 Recovery Tips

- **VS Code not in WSL?** Close it and relaunch with `code .` from WSL.
- **Token rejected?** Regenerate it and make sure it has repo access.
- **Push failed?** Check your remote URL with `git remote -v`.

---

You're now fully set up and ready to build your microblog!
