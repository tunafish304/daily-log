# August 24, 2025 â€“ Kickoff: Copilot Conversations Vault

## Highlights
- Decided to use VS Code instead of Zim for better markdown control and Git integration.
- Folder structure will be topic-based, with dated `.md` files inside each.
- Plan to archive yearly to manage scale (expecting ~3,000 files/year).
- Teaching kit will include:
  - Topic folders (e.g., "Intro to Markdown", "AI in Education")
  - Class-by-class lecture notes
  - Copilot-generated examples and prompts

## Next Steps
- Begin scaffolding microblog teaching kit folder
- Draft first topic: "Why Markdown Matters"
- Add `.vscode/settings.json` to exclude archive folders (future-proofing)
