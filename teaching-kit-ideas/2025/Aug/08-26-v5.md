##  Setting Up WSL (Windows Only)

If you're on Windows, you'll need to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Here's how to do it:

###  Step 1: Run the Install Command

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and type:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

You’ll see messages like:

```
Installing: WSL
Installing: Ubuntu
Downloading…
Installing…
```

Let it run — this part can take a few minutes.

---

###  Step 2: Reboot When Prompted

When the install finishes, you’ll see:

```
The requested operation is successful. Changes will not be effective until the system is rebooted.
```

Go ahead and restart your computer. This is required to finish the setup.

---

###  Step 3: First Boot (Ubuntu Setup)

After rebooting, Windows will automatically launch a terminal window. You’ll see:

```
Installing, this may take a few minutes...
Please create a user account.
```

This means Ubuntu is finishing its setup. You’re almost there.

---

###  Step 4: Create Your Linux Username & Password

Next, you’ll be prompted to enter:

```
Enter new UNIX username:
```

Type a short name (like `alex`, `student1`, or your first name). Then you’ll be asked to set a password:

```
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
```

You won’t see the password as you type — that’s normal. Just type it carefully both times.

 This account is your Linux identity inside WSL. You’ll use it when installing packages or running commands.

---

###  Step 5: Confirm You’re Inside Ubuntu

After you enter your password and hit return, Ubuntu finishes setting up and drops you into your Linux shell. You’ll see a prompt like this:



```bash
student1@DESKTOP-XXXX:~$
```

This means you’re inside Ubuntu and ready to go.<br>
Create your project folder inside WSL:<br>
```bash
    mkdir -p ~/projects/mykit
    cd ~/projects/mykit
    code .

Note: The above code ensures VS Code launches in WSL context with the correct paths and environment.
```
---

###  Step 6: Install Python (if needed)

Type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see something like `Command 'python3' not found`, run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

This installs Python and pip inside Ubuntu. You’ll be using this Python environment for your projects.

---

##  Install VS Code Extensions (GUI Only)

Now that VS Code is installed, let’s add the extensions you’ll need. Open VS Code and press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the Extensions tab. Then search for each extension below and click **Install**.

| Extension Name                     | What It Does                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Remote - WSL**                  | Connect VS Code to WSL (Windows only)         |
| **GitHub Copilot**                | AI code suggestions                           |
| **GitHub Copilot Chat**           | Chat-based coding assistant                   |
| **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** | GitHub integration for PRs and issues        |
| **Python Indent**                 | Smart indentation for Python                  |
| **Black Formatter**               | Auto-format Python code                       |
| **Debugpy**                       | Python debugging support                      |
| **Python**                        | Core Python extension                         |
| **Pylance**                       | Fast Python language server                   |
| **Python Environments**           | Manage Python virtual environments            |
| **Live Server**                   | Preview HTML/CSS/JS in browser                |

 If your project folder includes a `.vscode/extensions.json` file, VS Code will prompt you to install any missing extensions automatically.

---
## Install VS Code Extensions (With a bash script)

You can also install extensions with a bash script. Just put the following script (call it set-extensions.sh) in your projects folder. The usage details are in the script toward the top:
```
#!/bin/bash

# setup.sh — Install recommended VS Code extensions for teaching kit
# Usage: bash set-extensions.sh

echo "starting VS Code extension install..."

# List of extensions to install
extensions=(
  ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl
  github.copilot
  github.copilot-chat
  github.vscode-pull-request-github
  kevinrose.vsc-python-indent
  ms-python.black-formatter
  ms-python.debugpy
  ms-python.python
  ms-python.vscode-pylance
  ms-python.vscode-python-envs
  ritwickdey.liveserver
)

# Loop through and install each extension
for ext in "${extensions[@]}"; do
  echo "Installing: $ext"
  code --install-extension "$ext" --force
done

echo "All extensions installed. You’re good to go!"
```

---

##  VS Code Settings

Inside your project folder, create a `.vscode/` folder and add a file called `settings.json`. Paste the following into it:

```json
{
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,

  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,

  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,

  "git.enableSmartCommit": true,
  "git.confirmSync": false,

  "liveServer.settings.port": 5500,

  "extensions.ignoreRecommendations": false
}
```

This file helps VS Code remember your preferences and automatically configure your environment when you open the folder.

---
##  Recovery & Reset Tips

If something breaks or doesn’t look right, feel free to freak out, and then there are a few things you can try:

- Delete the `.vscode/` folder and restart VS Code.
- Reinstall extensions using the GUI (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → “Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)” to inspect or reset your settings.

## Script for Students

Fantastic, David. Here's a student-facing `setup.md` scaffold that walks through the WSL + VS Code setup with recovery modeling, visuals-ready placeholders, and minimal cognitive load. It’s designed to live inside `~/projects/microblog` and guide students through the exact flow you’ve modeled.

---

## 📘 `setup.md`: Student Guide to VS Code + WSL Setup

```markdown
# 🧠 Microblog Setup Guide (WSL + VS Code)

Welcome! This guide walks you through launching your development environment safely and reproducibly using WSL and VS Code.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Open WSL and Navigate to Your Project

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
wsl
cd ~/projects/microblog
```

This puts you inside the Linux environment where your code lives.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Launch VS Code in WSL Context

From inside the `microblog` folder, type:

```bash
code .
```

This opens VS Code in **Remote WSL mode**, which means:
- Your code runs in Linux.
- Your extensions and Python interpreter are scoped correctly.
- You’ll see `WSL: Ubuntu` in the bottom-left corner of VS Code.

> 💡 Tip: Always launch VS Code this way to avoid Windows-vs-WSL confusion.

---

## ✅ Step 3: Check Your `.vscode/settings.json`

Inside your project folder, you should have a `.vscode/settings.json` file. It should look like this:

```json
{
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,

  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,

  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,

  "git.enableSmartCommit": true,
  "git.confirmSync": false,

  "liveServer.settings.port": 5500,

  "extensions.ignoreRecommendations": false
}
```

> 🛠 If this file doesn’t exist, create it inside `.vscode/` using the VS Code file explorer or terminal.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Install VS Code Extensions (WSL Context)

Once VS Code is open in WSL, run the install script:

```bash
bash install_extensions.sh
```

This installs:
- Python, Pylance, Jupyter (shared)
- Remote WSL extension (Windows only)

> ⚠️ If you run this script outside WSL, extensions may install in the wrong place.

---

## 🔁 Recovery Tips

- **VS Code opened in Windows?** Close it. Reopen WSL and use `code .` inside your project folder.
- **Extensions not working?** Check the bottom-left corner of VS Code. If it doesn’t say `WSL: Ubuntu`, you’re not in the right context.
- **Python interpreter errors?** Make sure your `.venv` is created and `settings.json` points to it.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once your environment is set up:
- Create your virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
- Activate it: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install your dependencies: `pip install flask`

You're now ready to start building your microblog!

```

---

Would you like me to scaffold a matching `install_extensions.sh` and `.vscode/settings.json` artifact to pair with this guide inside the repo? I can also help you version it for Mac users with a separate `setup_mac.md` if you’re planning to support both platforms in parallel.

---
## Next time when they open vs code

Great question, David—and the answer hinges on **how** VS Code is launched and **what folder** it tries to open.

---

## 🧠 If VS Code is launched *outside* WSL (e.g. from Start Menu or desktop shortcut):

- VS Code will **not automatically open the microblog folder inside WSL**.
- It will default to the **Windows filesystem**, and unless students explicitly use the Remote WSL feature, they’ll be in the wrong context.
- The Python interpreter path (`.venv/bin/python`) and WSL extensions won’t work correctly.

---

## ✅ How to ensure VS Code opens in WSL context:

### Option 1: **Always launch from WSL terminal**
```bash
wsl
cd ~/projects/microblog
code .
```
This guarantees:
- VS Code opens in Remote WSL mode
- The correct folder (`~/projects/microblog`) is opened
- All settings and extensions behave as expected

### Option 2: **Use Remote Explorer from global VS Code**
If students open VS Code from Windows, they can:
1. Click the green corner badge (`><`) or use `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Choose `Remote-WSL: Open Folder in WSL`
3. Navigate to `/home/<username>/projects/microblog`

This manually switches context and opens the correct folder.

---

## 🧩 Can VS Code “remember” the WSL folder?

Yes—VS Code **remembers the last opened folder**, including WSL context. So if students:
- Previously opened `~/projects/microblog` in WSL
- Then launch VS Code again from Windows

They may see a prompt like:
> “Would you like to reopen the folder in WSL?”

But this behavior isn’t guaranteed—it depends on how VS Code was last closed and whether the folder was saved in the workspace history.

---

## 🛡️ Recovery Modeling Tip

You might teach students this mantra:
> “If you want your code to run in Linux, launch VS Code from Linux.”

And optionally scaffold a `.bashrc` alias:
```bash
alias dev='cd ~/projects/microblog && code .'
```

So they can just type `dev` to launch everything correctly.

---

## 🧠 VS Code Launch Script (Post-Setup)

Once setup is complete, students can launch VS Code from Windows and reopen their WSL project like this:

```bash
# Open global VS Code (Start Menu or shortcut)
# Then use Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P):
Remote-WSL: Reopen Folder in WSL

# Or use Remote Explorer (left sidebar) to select:
WSL: Ubuntu → /home/<username>/projects/microblog
```

> ✅ VS Code will remember this folder and reopen it in WSL automatically next time.
