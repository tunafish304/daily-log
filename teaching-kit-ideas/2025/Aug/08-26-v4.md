Absolutely, David — here’s your streamlined, student-ready `VSCode-Setup.md` with the **GUI-only extension install flow**, fully integrated and annotated for clarity, reproducibility, and dry-run safety. I’ve removed the CLI blocks and reinforced the `.vscode/` folder usage inside each project.

## 🧰 VS Code Teaching Kit Setup (WSL + Python + Git)

This guide walks students through installing and configuring a reproducible VS Code environment using WSL, Python, Git, and key extensions. It’s designed for minimal cognitive load and dry-run safety.

### 📦 Installation Matrix: macOS vs Windows 11

### 🧠 Notes & Tips

- **WSL**: After `wsl --install`, Ubuntu is the default. Confirm with `wsl -l -v`. Python must be installed inside WSL separately.
- **Git**: System-level Git is sufficient for class. WSL has its own Git if needed.
- **Extensions**: Use the GUI (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) to search and install. This is more intuitive and dry-run safe for students.
- **Settings**: Use `.vscode/settings.json` inside each project folder for reproducibility and portability.

---

## 🔌 Recommended Extensions (Install via GUI)

Students should open the Extensions tab (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for each extension below by name, and click **Install**:

| Extension Name                     | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Remote - WSL**                  | Connect VS Code to WSL (Windows only)        |
| **GitHub Copilot**                | AI code suggestions                          |
| **GitHub Copilot Chat**           | Chat-based coding assistant                  |
| **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** | GitHub integration for PRs and issues       |
| **Python Indent**                 | Smart indentation for Python                 |
| **Black Formatter**               | Auto-format Python code                      |
| **Debugpy**                       | Python debugging support                     |
| **Python**                        | Core Python extension                        |
| **Pylance**                       | Fast Python language server                  |
| **Python Environments**           | Manage Python virtual environments           |
| **Live Server**                   | Preview HTML/CSS/JS in browser               |

💡 _VS Code will prompt students to install missing extensions if `.vscode/extensions.json` is present in the repo._

---

## ⚙️ Recommended `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,

  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,

  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,

  "git.enableSmartCommit": true,
  "git.confirmSync": false,

  "liveServer.settings.port": 5500,

  "extensions.ignoreRecommendations": false
}
```

📁 Place this file in your project’s `.vscode/` folder. VS Code will auto-load it when the folder is opened.

---

## 📄 `.vscode/extensions.json` (Optional)

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl",
    "github.copilot",
    "github.copilot-chat",
    "github.vscode-pull-request-github",
    "kevinrose.vsc-python-indent",
    "ms-python.black-formatter",
    "ms-python.debugpy",
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-python.vscode-pylance",
    "ms-python.vscode-python-envs",
    "ritwickdey.liveserver"
  ]
}
```

This helps VS Code prompt students to install missing extensions when they open the repo.

---

## 🧪 Recovery & Reset Tips

- If something breaks, delete `.vscode/` and restart VS Code.
- Reinstall extensions via GUI (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) if needed.
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → “Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)” to inspect or reset settings.

Let me know if you want this scaffolded into your teaching kit repo or versioned for student onboarding. I can also help annotate it with inline comments or dry-run safety notes. You're modeling something powerful here—let’s make sure it lands cleanly.
---
Absolutely, David. Here's a student-facing walkthrough of the WSL install and first boot experience—written directly to them, step-by-step, with clarity and reassurance built in. You can drop this into your teaching kit as-is or tweak it for tone.

## 🧱 Setting Up WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

This guide walks you through installing WSL and getting your Ubuntu environment ready. Follow each step carefully, and don’t worry—if something doesn’t look exactly like this, we’ll help you recover.

---

### 🔧 Step 1: Run the Install Command

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and type:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

This starts the process of installing WSL and Ubuntu. You’ll see messages like:

```
Installing: WSL
Installing: Ubuntu
Downloading…
Installing…
```

This part can take a few minutes. Just let it run.

---

### 🔄 Step 2: Reboot When Prompted

When the install finishes, you’ll see something like:

```
The requested operation is successful. Changes will not be effective until the system is rebooted.
```

Go ahead and **restart your computer**. This is required to finish the setup.

---

### 🖥️ Step 3: First Boot (Ubuntu Setup)

After rebooting, Windows will automatically launch a terminal window. You’ll see:

```
Installing, this may take a few minutes...
Please create a user account.
```

This means Ubuntu is finishing its setup. You’re almost there.

---

### 👤 Step 4: Create Your Linux Username & Password

Next, you’ll be prompted to enter:

```
Enter new UNIX username:
```

Type a short name (like `alex`, `student1`, or your first name). Then you’ll be asked to set a password:

```
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
```

You won’t see the password as you type—this is normal. Just type it carefully both times.

✅ This account is your Linux identity inside WSL. You’ll use it when installing packages or running commands.

---

### 🧪 Step 5: Confirm You’re Inside Ubuntu

Once setup is complete, you’ll land in a Linux shell that looks like this:

```bash
student1@DESKTOP-XXXX:~$
```

This means you’re inside Ubuntu and ready to go.

---

### 🐍 Step 6: Install Python (if needed)

Type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see something like `Command 'python3' not found`, run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

This installs Python and pip inside Ubuntu. You’ll be using this Python environment for your projects.

---

### ✅ You’re Ready

Once Python is installed, you’re good to go. You can now open VS Code, connect to WSL, and start building your project.

If anything breaks or doesn’t match what you see here, don’t panic. We’ll walk through recovery steps together in class.
