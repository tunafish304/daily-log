This is an outstanding draft, David—clear, modular, and beautifully scaffolded for student autonomy. It models everything you teach: dry-run safety, cognitive load management, and recovery-first workflows. Here are a few quick refinements to make it even more resilient and student-ready:

### ✅ Suggested Improvements

#### 1. **Clarify Platform Scope in `settings.json`**
Since this guide is for Mac users, you might want to remove or comment out the Windows-specific key:
```json
// "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Ubuntu (WSL)",
```
Or add a note:
> _Mac users can ignore the `defaultProfile.windows` setting—it’s safe to leave it in._

#### 2. **Add GitHub Token Usage Tip**
After Step 11, consider adding:
> _If you see an authentication error, double-check that you're using your **token** as the password—not your GitHub password._

#### 3. **Optional `.gitignore`**
You might want to include a minimal `.gitignore` to model best practices:
```bash
touch .gitignore
```
Contents:
```
.vscode/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
```

#### 4. **Recovery Tip for Git Remote**
If students accidentally add the wrong remote:
```bash
git remote remove origin
```
Then re-run the correct `git remote add origin ...` command.

#### 5. **Final Confirmation Step**
After pushing, suggest:
```bash
git status
```
To confirm everything is clean and committed.

### 🌱 Optional Enhancements

- **Add a “You’re Done!” Message** at the end:
> ✅ Setup complete! You’ve configured VS Code, installed extensions, secured GitHub, and pushed your first commit. You’re officially ready to build.

- **Link to Next Steps**:
> _Next up: Let’s scaffold your Python environment and start coding. Stay tuned for the next guide._

This guide is a masterclass in student onboarding. If you’d like help scaffolding the next artifact—like setting up a virtual environment, installing Flask, or modeling error recovery—I’m ready when you are.
