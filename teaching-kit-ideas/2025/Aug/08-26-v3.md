Perfect recall, David—and thank you for reconstructing that so clearly. Let’s lock in the updated version of your `VSCode-Setup.md` with the changes we agreed on:

- ✅ Use the `.vscode/` folder inside each **project folder**, not global user settings.
- ✅ Load extensions via the **GUI**, not CLI, to reduce friction and cognitive load for students.
- ✅ Annotate the Markdown file to reflect this shift, emphasizing reproducibility and student autonomy.

Here’s the revised scaffold:

## 🧰 VS Code Teaching Kit Setup (WSL + Python + Git)

This guide walks students through installing and configuring a reproducible VS Code environment using WSL, Python, Git, and key extensions. It’s designed for minimal cognitive load and dry-run safety.

### 📦 Installation Matrix: macOS vs Windows 11

| Tool                  | macOS                                                                 | Windows 11                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### 🧠 Notes & Tips

- **WSL**: After `wsl --install`, Ubuntu is the default. Confirm with `wsl -l -v`. Python must be installed inside WSL separately.
- **Git**: System-level Git is sufficient for class. WSL has its own Git if needed.
- **Extensions**: Use the GUI (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) to search and install. This is more intuitive for students.
- **Settings**: Use `.vscode/settings.json` inside each project folder for reproducibility and portability.

---

## 🧩 VS Code Setup: Extensions & Settings

### 🔌 Recommended Extensions (Install via GUI)

Students should open the Extensions tab (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for each extension below, and click **Install**:

- **Remote WSL** → `ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl`
- **GitHub Copilot & GitHub integration**  
  → `github.copilot`, `github.copilot-chat`, `github.vscode-pull-request-github`
- **Python tooling**  
  → `kevinrose.vsc-python-indent`, `ms-python.black-formatter`, `ms-python.debugpy`, `ms-python.python`, `ms-python.vscode-pylance`, `ms-python.vscode-python-envs`
- **Live Server** → `ritwickdey.liveserver`

💡 _Extensions are installed per-user but `.vscode/extensions.json` helps prompt students when opening a repo._

---

### ⚙️ Recommended `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,

  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,

  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,

  "git.enableSmartCommit": true,
  "git.confirmSync": false,

  "liveServer.settings.port": 5500,

  "extensions.ignoreRecommendations": false
}
```

📁 Place this file in your project’s `.vscode/` folder. VS Code will auto-load it when the folder is opened.

---

### 📄 `.vscode/extensions.json` (Optional)

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl",
    "github.copilot",
    "github.copilot-chat",
    "github.vscode-pull-request-github",
    "kevinrose.vsc-python-indent",
    "ms-python.black-formatter",
    "ms-python.debugpy",
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-python.vscode-pylance",
    "ms-python.vscode-python-envs",
    "ritwickdey.liveserver"
  ]
}
```

This helps VS Code prompt students to install missing extensions when they open the repo.

---

## 🧪 Recovery & Reset Tips

- If something breaks, delete `.vscode/` and restart VS Code.
- Reinstall extensions via GUI (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) if needed.
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → “Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)” to inspect or reset settings.

Let me know if you want this scaffolded into your teaching kit repo or annotated with inline comments for students. I can also help version-control it or write a dry-run safe onboarding script. You’re almost there—let’s make this bulletproof.

Great catch, David. The names I listed are the **publisher.extension IDs**, which are used for CLI installs. But in the **GUI search window**, students should search by the **extension display name**, which is often simpler and more intuitive.

Here’s a quick mapping of what to type into the GUI search bar:

| 🔌 Extension Display Name            | 🆔 CLI ID (for reference)                          |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Remote - WSL                        | `ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl`                     |
| GitHub Copilot                      | `github.copilot`                                  |
| GitHub Copilot Chat                 | `github.copilot-chat`                             |
| GitHub Pull Requests and Issues     | `github.vscode-pull-request-github`              |
| Python Indent                       | `kevinrose.vsc-python-indent`                     |
| Black Formatter                     | `ms-python.black-formatter`                       |
| Debugpy                             | `ms-python.debugpy`                               |
| Python                              | `ms-python.python`                                |
| Pylance                             | `ms-python.vscode-pylance`                        |
| Python Environments                 | `ms-python.vscode-python-envs`                    |
| Live Server                         | `ritwickdey.liveserver`                           |

🧠 **Tip for students**: In the Extensions tab (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), just type the display name (e.g., “Pylance” or “Live Server”) and look for the matching icon and publisher. VS Code will show the correct extension even if the name is partial.

Would you like me to annotate this in your Markdown file so students know exactly what to search for and why the CLI IDs are included? I can also add a dry-run note explaining how to verify installs.
